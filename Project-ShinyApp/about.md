# What is Spotify Music?

An interactive app to easily explore music of Spofity. The app utilizes a custom dataset, which was collected using Spotify's API. The idea is to predict whether you will like a song or not, based on your musical preferences.

Each song has different attributes such as name, artist, duration, and music-related features such as energy, instrumentality, tempo, how danceable it is, etc.
